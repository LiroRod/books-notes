# Summations

Many reference books have tables of useful formulas for summations that have simple closed forms. We'll see them again when we cover mathematical induction and see how to formally prove that they are correct.

Only a very small number of closed forms need to be memorized. Aside from the geometric series formula you should also know this closed form:

[(n over sum over i=1)i = (n(n+1))/2]

Here's one way to convince yourself it's right. On graph paper, draw a box [n] units high and [n+1] units wide. Its area is [n(n+1)]. Fill the leftmost part of each row to represent one term of the summation: The lext box in the first row, the left two boxes in the second row, and so on. This makes a little triangular pattern which fill exactly half the box.
